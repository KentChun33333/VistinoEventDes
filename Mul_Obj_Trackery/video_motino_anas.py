# The property graph contains connected entities (the nodes) which can hold any number of attributes (key-value-pairs). Nodes can be tagged with labels representing their different roles in your domain.

# In addition to contextualizing node and relationship properties, labels may also serve to attach metadata—​index or constraint information—​to certain nodes
