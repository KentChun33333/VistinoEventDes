There should be a way to do it by setting only the Path environment variable 
but I could never get that to work. 
The only thing that worked for me was to manually 
copy the CuDNN files into the appropriate folders in your CUDA installation. 
For example, if your CUDA installation is in C:\CUDA\v7.0 and you extracted CuDNN to C:\CuDNN you would copy as follows:
•The contents of C:\CuDNN\lib\x64\ would be copied to C:\CUDA\v7.0\lib\x64\ 
•The contents of C:\CuDNN\include\ would be copied to C:\CUDA\v7.0\include\
•The contents of C:\CuDNN\bin\ would be copied to C:\CUDA\v7.0\bin\

After that it should work.
